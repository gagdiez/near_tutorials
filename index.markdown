If you are reading this, you are probably thinking about developing a smartcontract
in the NEAR blockchain. Well, you have come to the right place. This website will
guide you through all the steps needed, from developing to testing and deploying
a contract. And even if you are a more advance user, you can still find
important information such as how to perform unit and integration testing, as
well as how to securely perform cross-contract comunications.

Smartcontracts in the NEAR ecosystem are writen in either the [assemblyscript](website)
or [Rust](website) language. While it is not necessary to be an expert in either
language, we will assume you have a basic knowledge of at least one of them.
If you never used any of them we recommend you to start [here](cite) with
Rust and [here](as) with assemblyscript. Remember, you don't need to be an
expert, you just need to understand enough to be able to follow along the tutorial.

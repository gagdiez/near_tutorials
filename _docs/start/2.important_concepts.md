a `Context`. Such context includes information such as: how much computational
resources are available, who evoqued your method, how much money there is
attached, etc. Understanding the context and how to access it very important

## Contract Name

## Signer

## Predecesor

## Block Height

As with every other piece of software, your contract is a collection of 
instruction which are executed in sequence. When working on a smartcontract,
each operations consumes what is know as GAS.

# Storage
{: .no_toc }

As in every app, you might want to persist some information on your smart contract.
For this, the NEAR SDK implements a variety of structures that can readily
simplify your life.

Explain each type, explain they can support objects as well as simple types
## Storage

In AS we will need to explain storage.set(), storage.get() and storage.getSome()

{% toggle Assemblyscript %}
```as
logging.log("Example in typescript")
```
{% endtoggle %}


{% toggle Rust %}
```rust
println!("Example in RUST")
```
{% endtoggle %}

## PersistentMap
## PersistentVector
## PersistentDeque

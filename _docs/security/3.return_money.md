If someone attached money, you made a call, and on return it failed, you need
to return the money to the user

# Remembering Attached Money 
Users can call your function, then you call another contract and get a callback

# Returning it
Your original function was called with some money attached, and it finished
correctly. The money is now yours. If the callback failed, then make sure you
have enough gas in the callback to send the money back.

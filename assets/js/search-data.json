    "content": "If you are reading this, you are probably thinking about developing a smartcontract in the NEAR blockchain. Well, you have come to the right place. This website will guide you through all the steps needed, from developing to testing and deploying a contract. And even if you are a more advance user, you can still find important information such as how to perform unit and integration testing, as well as how to securely perform cross-contract comunications. Smartcontracts in the NEAR ecosystem are writen in either the assemblyscript or Rust language. While it is not necessary to be an expert in either language, we will assume you have a basic knowledge of at least one of them. If you never used any of them we recommend you to start here with Rust and here with assemblyscript. Remember, you don’t need to be an expert, you just need to understand enough to be able to follow along the tutorial. ",

While knowing how a blockchain works can be useful, it is not actually necesary that you know every detail. As programers, we can simply abstract away the underlying complexity. For us it is sufficient to understand that we will be writting apps that execute in an environment with nice advantages but important contraints: . | Computational resources are much more limited than on a consumers PC. Forget about iterating an array of thousands of entries. Data structures are your friends. | Interactions with other apps (other smartcontracts) are asynchronous and independent. This means that once your contract called another one, its execution finished. If there is a return, you will have to handle it as a new call to your smart contract. | We will be dealing with real money, so security must be our top concern.
